# NeedlemanWunsch
NeedlemanWunsch algorithm implementation for protein/DNA sequences

Main purpose of this problem is aligning DNA or amino acid sequences depending on their scores match/unmatch. To achieve this goal, we prefer to use Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm to find out best score then trackback matrix to get aligned result.
To run program,fasta sequences and BLOSUM matrix must be in same directory with source code and fasta sequences must be passed as input.
